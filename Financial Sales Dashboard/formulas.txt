Contribution margin (CM), defined as selling price minus variable cost, 
is a measure of the ability of a company to cover variable costs with revenue. 
The amount leftover, the contribution, covers fixed costs or is profit.

1. Contribution Margin = total Revenue – total Variable Costs.

2. Revenue = Quantity * price 

3. Net Sales = (Total Units Sold x Sale Per Unit Price) – Sales Returns – Allowances – Discounts



-- (total revenue = (Total Units Sold x Sale Per Unit Price)
-- sales return  = profit/total revenue  
-- net sales revenue = Gross sales(revenue) – sales Returns – Allowances – Discounts
   
   Allowances: $100
   Discounts: $1000
   Net Sales or sales return: $88,400
   Gross Sales: $90,000

-- contribution = selling price - variable cost
-- contribution % = contribution/net sales
-- Total Variable Costs = Cost Per Unit x Total Number of Units.

-- cost amount = cm/revenue
